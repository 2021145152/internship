############################## move ##############################
---
verb: move
noun: pipette
prompt: Analyze the image carefully and answer with only 'Yes' or 'No':  
**Is the very bottom tip of the pipette (the liquid-contact point) directly aligned above the opening of the beaker on the table, ensuring precise liquid transfer?**  
Key criteria for judgment:  
1. **Tip Visibility**: The pipette's lowest tip must be clearly visible in the image.  
2. **Beaker Presence**: If the beaker is partially occluded, verify there is clear visual evidence of its presence directly beneath the pipette tip. If no beaker is visibly present beneath the tip, the answer must be 'No'.
If all conditions are met, answer 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.
